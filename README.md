Context API

## Problem

1. Create a context by the name AuthContext
2. create a AuthContextProvider component which will wrap the entire application around it
3. create a isAuth and a toggleAuth function
4. pass these values into your context provider
5. create a navbar with a button to login or logout (change with the isAuth variable)
6. use the reqres.in api for login to achieve this task
7. create another component which will display the login status of the user along with the token
8. these two components should not share props and the app state should be accessed through the context api
